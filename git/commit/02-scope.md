## Introduction
### What are Commit Scopes?
Commit scopes are optional contextual identifiers used in version control commit messages to specify the component, module, or area of the codebase affected by changes. These scopes have emerged as a vital element in modern development workflows, providing precise location context for modifications within large-scale projects.

A commit scope is a parenthetical qualifier that follows the commit type, identifying the specific section of the codebase being modified. This additional context enables more granular tracking and organization of changes across complex systems.

### Why Should We Use Them?
Commit scopes have become increasingly important in larger projects because they provide immediate location context without requiring code review or file inspection. This contextual information serves several critical purposes:

1. It enables developers to quickly identify relevant changes in their area of responsibility
2. It facilitates more efficient code review by highlighting the system components affected
3. It improves change tracking by categorizing modifications by project area
4. It supports better release management by organizing changes by component

The effort invested in properly scoping commits delivers substantial benefits through improved change navigation and enhanced project organization, particularly in larger codebases with multiple components.

### How Do We Use Them?
Implementing commit scopes requires understanding your project's architecture and establishing consistent naming conventions. While adding scopes is straightforward syntactically, the challenge lies in defining and maintaining meaningful scope boundaries that reflect your project's structure.

```md
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

While some projects maintain a strict set of predefined scopes aligned with their architecture (e.g., api, ui, core, auth), others allow more flexible scope definitions based on feature areas or team ownership. This customization should align with your project's organization while maintaining clarity and consistency.

## Common Commit Scopes
### Core Application Scopes
The following scope categories represent fundamental areas commonly found in software applications. These scopes provide a structured way to identify the specific components affected by changes in version control systems.

#### `auth`
Indicates changes related to authentication and authorization systems, including user authentication flows, permission management, and security token handling.

```md
feat(auth): implement JWT refresh token mechanism
fix(auth): resolve session timeout handling
```

#### `api`
Encompasses modifications to API endpoints, request handling, response formatting, and API-specific middleware. This scope helps track changes to the application's external interfaces.

```md
feat(api): add pagination to user search endpoint
fix(api): correct response format for error states
```

#### `ui`
Designates changes to user interface components, layouts, styles, and client-side interactions. This scope typically covers frontend-specific modifications.

```md
feat(ui): implement responsive navigation menu
fix(ui): resolve button alignment in mobile view
```

#### `core`
Represents changes to the application's core business logic, fundamental services, and critical operational components.

```md
feat(core): implement transaction processing engine
fix(core): correct calculation precision in billing module
```

#### `db`
Relates to database operations, schema modifications, query optimizations, and data migration scripts.

```md
feat(db): add indices for user search queries
fix(db): optimize join operations in reporting queries
```

#### `config`
Identifies changes to application configuration, environment settings, and system parameters.

```md
feat(config): add support for custom logging levels
fix(config): correct environment variable handling
```

#### `utils`
Encompasses modifications to utility functions, helper methods, and shared tools used across the application.

```md
feat(utils): add date formatting utilities
fix(utils): correct string sanitization function
```

### Infrastructure Scopes
While core scopes cover application components, the following scopes address infrastructure and operational aspects. These should be documented in your project's guidelines to ensure consistent usage.

#### `deploy`
Indicates changes related to deployment processes, infrastructure configurations, and hosting environments.

```md
feat(deploy): implement blue-green deployment strategy
fix(deploy): resolve CDN cache invalidation
```

#### `ci`
Represents modifications to continuous integration pipelines, build processes, and automated testing infrastructure.

```md
feat(ci): add performance testing to pipeline
fix(ci): correct test environment configuration
```

#### `monitoring`
Addresses changes to application monitoring, logging systems, and observability infrastructure.

```md
feat(monitoring): implement custom error tracking
fix(monitoring): correct metric collection intervals
```

## Implementation Guidelines
### Adoption Considerations
Before implementing semantic commit conventions, carefully evaluate their applicability to your project's specific context and team dynamics. While these practices represent industry standards, their adoption should align with your project's needs and team capabilities.

Consider the following factors when evaluating these guidelines:
- Project scale and complexity
- Team size and experience level
- Existing workflows and processes
- Long-term maintenance requirements

Organizations should customize these practices to match their specific requirements while maintaining the core principles of clarity and consistency.

### Best Practices
#### Maintain Scope Format Consistency
Consistency in commit scope formatting is essential for realizing the full benefits of semantic commits. Inconsistent or arbitrary scope usage reduces clarity and complicates project maintenance.

When exceptions to standard scope formatting become necessary, document them clearly and ensure they remain rare. Establish explicit guidelines for handling special cases while preserving overall consistency in your scope usage.

```md
### Incorrect Format Examples
feat(userAuth): implement password reset
> Inconsistent scope naming (should be auth)

fix[api-server] resolve timeout issue
> Incorrect scope delimiter syntax

feat(front-end/components): add navigation menu
> Overly specific scope hierarchy

### Correct Format Examples
feat(auth): implement password reset flow
fix(api): resolve request timeout handling
feat(ui): implement responsive navigation menu
> Each follows the standard format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### Select Appropriate Scopes and Boundaries
Commit scopes should precisely identify the affected system components while maintaining appropriate granularity. Common scope-related challenges include:
- Defining overly broad scopes that lack specificity
- Creating excessively granular scopes that fragment the codebase
- Mixing different architectural levels in scope definitions

Each scope should represent a logical boundary in your system architecture. While components may have internal subdivisions, commit scopes should align with your project's primary architectural divisions to maintain clarity and usefulness.

```md
### Suboptimal Scope Examples
feat(system): add user authentication
> Scope too broad, lacks specific context

fix(userProfileModalButton): correct click handler
> Scope too granular, should use broader component scope

feat(api/auth/jwt): implement token refresh
> Unnecessarily deep scope hierarchy

### Optimal Scope Examples
feat(auth): implement OAuth authentication flow
fix(ui): resolve profile modal event handling
feat(api): add JWT token refresh endpoint
> Each uses appropriate architectural boundaries for scope
```

#### Document Scope Conventions
Maintaining comprehensive documentation of your commit scope conventions is crucial for:
- Ensuring consistent scope selection across teams
- Providing clear component boundaries
- Supporting architectural understanding
- Facilitating effective code organization

Documentation should address:
- Defined scope categories and their boundaries
- Scope naming conventions and formats
- Component hierarchy and scope relationships
- Team-specific scope customizations

Your scope documentation should provide clear guidance for identifying appropriate component boundaries and selecting the right scope level for changes. Focus on creating a practical, maintainable scope hierarchy that reflects your system's architecture.
