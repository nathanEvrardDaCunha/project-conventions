### 4.4. Importance of Body
<!-- TODO: Refine explanation to be more formal, detailed and professional -->
The body of the commit allow developer to indicate to others exactly what applying it will do. It's like telling to other what was here before and what will be done after applying it. The body is optional but recommended in general especially if you don't work alone on your project.

```md
# Skeleton of commit with optional body

<type>(<scope>): <description>

(body)

> docs(commit): add commit example to body section
>
> - Add commit example with optional body for better user comprehension.
```

### 5.3. Always include relevant body
<!-- TODO: Refine explanation to be more formal, detailed and professional -->
The body can always be part of your commit so it's a good idea to always write one. it hugely enhance the capabilities of your peers to understand the consequence of your action and work before applying or using it.

```md
# Examples - Good practice

We understand what will happen.
> docs(commit): add scope recommendation in practice section
>
> - Add scope recommendation part in practice section.
>
> - Add introduction to scope recommendation explaining it's purpose.
>
> - Add example to scope recommendation to enhance user understanding.

# Examples - Bad practice

We can only guess what will happen but not how much.
> docs(commit): add scope recommendation in practice section 
```
